1. "Flowchart Maze: Simple Logic Puzzles"

Objective: To guide a character through a maze by creating a flowchart that dictates the correct path, 
            using logic to navigate obstacles and reach the end goal.

Concept: Players guide a character through a simple maze by creating flowcharts
         that determine the correct path.

Gameplay: Each level presents a small maze with a starting point and an end goal.
          Players drag and drop basic flowchart symbols (start, end, decision, process)
          to create a path for the character to follow. Decision symbols could represent 
          choices like "turn left" or "turn right." Process symbols could represent actions
          like "move forward."

Example: A level could have a maze with three paths. Players might need to create
         a flowchart that first checks if there's a wall to the right, then turns
         left if there is, and moves forward otherwise.

Ease of Development: This game involves very basic game logic: character movement
                     and checking for walls. The UI would need simple elements for
                     dragging and dropping flowchart symbols.
