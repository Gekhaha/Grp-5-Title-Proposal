3. "Flowchart Match: Simple Logic Puzzles"


Objective: To solve logic puzzles by matching flowchart symbols in the correct order to form a logical
           sequence that completes a given task or solves a problem.

Concept: Players solve logic puzzles by matching flowchart symbols to create correct logic sequences.

Gameplay: Each level presents a set of flowchart symbols and a goal. Players drag and drop the symbols
          to create a sequence that achieves the goal.

Example: A level might require players to create a flowchart that guides a character to a specific
         location by matching symbols that represent actions like "move forward," "turn left," and "turn right."

Ease of Development: This game involves simple logic and UI elements for matching symbols.
                      It focuses on visual logic puzzles rather than complex game mechanics.
